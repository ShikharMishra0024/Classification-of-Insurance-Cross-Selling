# Classification of Insurance Cross-Selling

This repository contains my submission for the Kaggle competition **"Classification of Insurance Cross-Selling"**. The task involves predicting whether existing customers would be interested in purchasing additional insurance products based on their profiles.

In this competition, the objective is to predict whether an insurance policyholder will be interested in cross-buying additional insurance products. The data contains customer information such as age, vehicle details, previous claims, and demographic details.

## Dataset
The dataset provided includes the following key features:
- `Gender`: The gender of the policyholder.
- `Age`: Age of the policyholder.
- `Region_Code`: Encoded region information for policyholders.
- `Vehicle_Age`: Age of the insured vehicle.
- `Driving_License`: Indicator if the policyholder holds a valid driving license.
- `Vehicle_Damage`: History of vehicle damage.
- and more...
